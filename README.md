IDP_coevolution_RSI 
============

Niranjan's RSI project

I have attached my report as pdf, doc, and docx, presentation as ppt, pptx, and pdf, and the code as m (matlab) files
and text files.

For the file SCA_disprot: input multiple sequence alignment (as a fasta file) and protein of interest sequence (as a fasta file) and assign name of output folder

For the file functionalresidues: input output name from SCA_disprot- code will output functionally important residues

For the file bound_IDP_residues: input PDB file and chain IDs of MoRF and binding partner- code will output MoRF residues physically bound to binding partner
